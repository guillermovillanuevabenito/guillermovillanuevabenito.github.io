<p>The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following questions: "Given a list of cities and the distance between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that vistis each city exactly one and returns to the original city?"</p>
</div>

We are considering the solution of the symmetric version of the TSP over a complete graph G = (V, E) with n = \|V\| nodes. More specifically, our graph have 12 nodes, n = 12. Moreover, since it is a complete graph the number of edges is

$$ |E|= n(n−1) = 66 $$

The graph is non-directed and each edge \\((i,j) \\) has its associated cost \\(c_{i,j} \\) satisfying

$$c_{i,j} = c_{j,i}$$

In order to compute the solution of the symmetric TSP, we randomly generated the cost matrix (or distance matrix) C.

In this project we solve the TSP for a small intance problem by applying problem relaxations and different heuristics finding lower and upper bounds of the solution. You can download the project [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/OR_TSP.pdf).
