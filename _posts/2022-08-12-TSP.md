We are considering the solution of the symmetric version of the TSP over a complete graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n = \|V \|$ nodes. More specifically, our graph have 12 nodes, $n = 12$. Moreover, since it is a complete graph the number of edges is

$$ \| E \|= n(nâˆ’1) =66 $$

The graph is non-directed and each edge $(i,j)$ has its associated cost $c_{i,j}$ satisfying

$$c_{i,j} = c_{j,i}$$

In order to compute the solution of the symmetric TSP, we randomly generated the cost matrix C.
