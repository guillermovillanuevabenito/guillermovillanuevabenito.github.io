Setting up a good Data Science Environment is first step before starting any project. In this post, I will summarize my current python-Data Science Environment set up.

## Python virtual environment

Python virtual environments allows you to install different versions of python and python packages into different directories on your computer. The idea is to set up a new python environment for each new data scientist project. This is defenitly a best practice.

#### Create a new python virtual environment
To create a new python environment called _env_, go to your project's directory and run the bellow command.

```
python3 -m venv env
```

#### Activate a python virtual environment
In order to use the new python virual environment you need to activate it.

```
source env/bin/activate
```

#### Close a python virtual environment
Finally, in oder to leave the virual environmente run:

```
deactivate
```

#### Installing python libraries
Once your python vertual environment has been created and activated, you can start installing packages. Suppose you want to install the <a href="https://numpy.org/" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">_NumPy_</a> library:

```
pip install numpy
```

In case you want to see the list of installed packages:

```
pip list
```

#### Create/use requirements.txt file
You can also export the list of all the installed packages and versions by running:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This is a good practice since it will allow collaborators to clone your python virtual environment with all its dependencies running the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Version control with Git and GitHub
<a href="https://git-scm.com/" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">Git</a> allows you to keep track of the changes in your source code. <a href="https://github.com/" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">GitHub</a> is a hosting service for Git repositories. You will be able to store your tracked code on the cloud using GitHub.

#### Initializing a Git repository in an existing directory
For start controlling a project directory with Git run the following command

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial porject version'
```

#### Ignoring files
You can force Git to ignore some files by creating a file _.gitignore_ listing them. You can create the file running

```
echo > ".gitignore"
```

and then list the desired files that you want to ignore.

#### Adding a remote repository using GitHub
Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet. GitHub enables you to collaborate with others by managing remote repositories.

Firstly, you will need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">create a new GitHub repository</a>.

Afterwards, you can push your locally hosted repository to GitHub from the command line.

```
git remote add origin <url>
git push -u origin main
```

## VS Code
VS code is a great code editor that comes with lots of functionalities and built-in extensions. I highly recommend to check out its built-in source control system. I include a short list of the extensions that I have installed.

- Atom Material Theme
- GitHub Markdown Preview
- gitignore
- Python
- Tabnine AI Autocomplete
- Excel Viewer

## Jupyter notebooks
Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for data analysis, exploration and visualization. JupyterLab is the lastest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

You can install it using _pip_ with

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

and then launch jupyterab with

```
jupyter-lab
```

The IPython kernel is the Python execution backened for Jupyter. For using a kernel in your virtual environment _env_ run the following commands

```
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --name=env
```

Afterwards, jupyterLab automatically ensures that the IPython kernel is available, and you will be able to choose your virtual environment as a kernel in jupyterLab when opening a new notebook.

## Data Science Project Structure
