Setting up a good Data Science Environment is first step before starting any project. This post is aimed at summarizing my current python-Data Science Environment. Note that it will not be forever since there are, for sure, platforms or frameworks that I do not know about and which I will be glad to find out. Feel free to share with me anything related to it.

I am currentlt using macOs, and therefore everything posted here correspond to the macOs environment.

I will describe how I set up different python environments for each of my projects and why I have decided to use VS code. Moreover I will also summarize how to track changes to files in projects over time using Git and GitHub and build a useful cheatsheet for that.
