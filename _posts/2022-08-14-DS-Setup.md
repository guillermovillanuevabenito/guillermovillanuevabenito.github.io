To be able to use Python, you first need to install it. In this post, I will describe I set up my python environment on macOS.

You will know about how I set up different python environments for each of my projects, why I have decided to use VS code and how I track changes to files in projects over time using Git and GitHub.

I will also talk about Sourcetree, which might be useful for visualizing and manage your repositories.
