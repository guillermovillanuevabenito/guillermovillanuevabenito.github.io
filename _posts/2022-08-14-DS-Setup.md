Setting up a good Data Science Environment is first step before starting any project. This post is aimed at summarizing my current python-Data Science Environment set up and also be a place where I can briefly describe the tools and frameworks that I have used.

Note that the choice of some tools for specific aims is based on my experience which is evolving over time. There might be other amzing tools or frameworks that I do not know about and which I will be glad to find out. Feel free to share with me anything related to it.

I am currently using macOs, and therefore everything below described will be linked to the macOs operating system. However, many things will be common with other operating systems, such as Windows or Linux.

I will describe how I set up different python environments for each of my projects and also explain why I have decided to use VS code. I will summarize how to track changes to files in projects over time using Git and GitHub, and also build a useful cheatsheet for that.
