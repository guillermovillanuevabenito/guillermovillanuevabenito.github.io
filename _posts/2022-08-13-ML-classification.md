Multiclass classification is the problem of classigying instances into one of three or more classes. The multiclass classification problem can be solved by naturally extending the binary classification technique for some algorithms.


Traffic accidents can be classified in 4 classes according to its impact on traffic. In this project, we apply two classification algorithms (kernel SVMs and random forest) to a traffic accident data set.

The goal is to predict the degree of impact of an accident given the value of a set of explanatory variables and study the performance of the predictors.
