I am building my personal website from scratch which is currently hosted on GitHub Pages. For that reason, I am also using tyhe static site generator Jekyll.

The idea of this personal website is to be a place on the Internet where not only I can build a extended web version of my curriculum, but also I can gather and share interesting projects that I have or will carry out during my academic and professional career. 

<div class="highlight-RST"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>Note</span></div>
<div class="highlights"> 
<p>The main goal of this website is to have a web version repository of interesting topics and projects done be me to the present today.</p>
</div>

It is not intended to build a professional website but a useful, minimalistic and nice enough website for the purposes above mentioned. However, this website is and will be under development so as to be updated and add new features and functionalities in order to produce a better user experience.

The source code for the website is available in "[GitHub-personal-website](https://github.com/guillermovillanuevabenito/guillermovillanuevabenito.github.io)". Feel free to contribute.
