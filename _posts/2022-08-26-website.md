I am building my personal website from scratch which is powered by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">GitHub Pages</a> and hosted hosted on GitHub. I am also using the static site generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">Jekyll</a>, with built-in support for GitHub Pages, following GitHub Pages's recommendations.

The idea of this personal website is to be a place on the Internet where not only I can build an extended web version of my curriculum, but also I can gather and share interesting projects that I have or will carry out during my academic and professional career. 

<div class="highlight-note"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>Note</span></div>
<div class="highlights-note"> 
<p>The main goal of this website is to have a web version repository of interesting topics and projects.</p>
</div>

It is not intended to build a professional website but a useful, minimalistic and nice enough website for the purposes above mentioned. Moreover, this website is and will be under development so as to be updated and add new features and functionalities in order to produce a better user experience.

<div class="highlight-warning"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i><span>Warning</span></div>
<div class="highlights-warning"> 
<p>I am not a proffesional web developer. This website is released without any warranty.</p>
</div>

The source code for the website is available in <a href="https://github.com/guillermovillanuevabenito/guillermovillanuevabenito.github.io" style="color: rgb(165, 15, 15);text-decoration:none; :hover { color: black;};">GitHub-website</a>. Feel free to contribute.
