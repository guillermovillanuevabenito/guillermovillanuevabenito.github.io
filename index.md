I'm a mathematics and engineering physics graduate from the Interdisciplinary Higher Education Center (CFIS) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). Currently, I'm a master’s student from the Master’s degree in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering (MAMME) at UPC.

I'm very interested in applications of mathematics and engineering to real-world problems. Particularly, in data science, machine learning, operations research and optimization.

Welcome to  my personal website where I will share some interesting projects. You will also find my CV and contact details here!.
